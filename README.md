# Up in the Air - An Educational Game/Simulation of the Stock Market

Up in the Air is a web application created to educate the youth about the stock market in an entertaining manner. The game includes a simulation of the stock market in the form of uniquely designed plants and weather patterns that affect their cost, informative lessons in the form of a map, and quizzes for each lesson for a chance to win coins. The web application was designed using Figma and built in one week with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and hosted with Firebase. All the plants were individually designed using Adobe Illustrator.
